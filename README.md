## Task

* Create a web application running rock, paper, scissors.  
  - Prompt player input through the browser.
  - Create a random move for the computer.
  - Play the best of five rounds.
  - Check for a winner after each round.
  - Display the score after each round.
  -	Display the overall winner best of out of five games

### Notes

Prompts user for input.

Generates random computer input.

Discovers winner of each round.

Plays five rounds.

Code can definitely be made DRY, especially for the instance of 'if' 'else if' statements in the start function.  
Further work needs to be to calculate running total, and eventually overall winner.
